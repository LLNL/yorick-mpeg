This is a standalone mpeg movie encoder for yorick, intended to
replace the mpeg encoder in the yorick-z package, which requires the
ffmpeg package.  The libavcodec directory contains a version of ffmpeg
0.4.9-pre1 which has been stripped of everything except MPEG-1
encoding.  See the libavcodec subdirectory README for more, and the
ffmpeg web pages:

http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffmpeg/

This package is not very complete, and you will probably have to
configure libavcodec/Makefile by hand.  It can be made to run on both
Linux and Mac OS X platforms, but I have had much less success
elsewhere.  In particular, it does not seem to run correctly under
Windows or on AIX SP machines.
